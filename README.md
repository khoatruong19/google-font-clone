## Description
This is the React project called **Spider Font** which is a clone of [Google Font](https://fonts.google.com). Similar to **Google Font**, this website provides thousand of fonts for web developers to use for their projects. You can search for your favourite ones, preview and then embed them to your applications for free. I had such a great time building this project because it helped not only show my **React** dev skills but also sharpen it.
